## 👨‍💻 **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the `Genius_Game.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.  
3. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.  

---

## **How to Play**  
1. The game starts by generating a random LED sequence.  
2. Memorize the sequence of lights and sounds.  
3. Press the buttons in the **same order** to replicate the sequence.  
4. Each successful round increases the sequence length.  
5. The game ends if you make a mistake.
