A classic memory challenge where you repeat sequences of lights and sounds! Built with Arduino Uno.  
This project was built by me and applied with the students at the IRMÃ FLÓRIDA MESTAGA school.

## 👨‍💻 **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the `Genius_Game.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.  
3. Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.  

---

## **How to Play**  
1. The game starts by generating a random LED sequence.  
2. Memorize the sequence of lights and sounds.  
3. Press the buttons in the **same order** to replicate the sequence.  
4. Each successful round increases the sequence length.  
5. The game ends if you make a mistake.
